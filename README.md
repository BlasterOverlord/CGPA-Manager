# CGPA Manager
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This is my final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).
It is merely a simple cgpa calculator that also shows some useful information like how much gpa you need to score each semester to achieve your targeted cgpa by the time you graduate.
All user information along with their course and cgpa data is stored securely in a database. Users can login and update their progress anytime they want. Users need to create an account and login to use this web app made using flask.
